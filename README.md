# Capstone Project: The Persuasive Power of Words
by Nee Bimin

#### Problem Statement

Once we step out into the working world, we need to communicate to get our ideas across. The question is, how do we use words to persuade others to agree with our viewpoints? In this project, we will use TED Talks data set from Kaggle which contains ratings for persuasiveness of the talks. Classifiers - decision trees, random forest regressors, and linear regression will be deployed to find the key predictors of persuasiveness. 

This project aims to not only help us get an idea of words that persuade, but also words that dissuade to avoid using those words in meetings and presentations. To evaluate the models, we will compare it against the baseline accuracy, and also consider the f1-score, which can be understood as the weighted average of the precision and recall, where an F1 score reaches its best value at 1 and worst score at 0.
